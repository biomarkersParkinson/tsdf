# Example files

This folder contains the two example files listed in [the publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11294).
We gave them the name of `flat` and `hierarchical`.

It also contains a couple of wrong files used for testing.
`wrongversion` contains an unsupported version number.
`missingkey` misses the `endianness` mandatory key.
