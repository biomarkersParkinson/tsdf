# Example files

This folder contains the example files listed in [the publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11294).
We gave them the name of `flat` and `hierarchical`.

In addition, we introduce `dummy` metadata (`dummy_*.json`) and binary (`dummy_*.bin`) files, used to test reading and writing of actual files.

Finally, this folder contains a couple of wrong files used for testing.
`wrongversion` contains an unsupported version number.
`missingkey` misses the `endianness` mandatory key.
