If you have git installed, the latest version of tsdf can be installed by typing: pip install 'tsdf @ git+https://github.com/biomarkersParkinson/tsdf.git' Otherwise you can install it manually by following these steps: Download or clone the content from our repository . Browse to the folder you just downloaded (typically: cd tsdf/ ). Install using your package manager (typically: pip install . ). What now? Now you can import functions from the tsdf Python package.
